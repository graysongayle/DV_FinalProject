#How to Reproduce Our Work:
Step 1: Create GitHub Repo with necessary folders for partners to collaborate
      00 Doc contains the .Rmd and HTML files
      01 Data contains the data set that was worked with
      02 Shiny contains the server and user interface (ui) for the Shiny App
Step 2: Use an interesting data set with data that may be easily and interestingly manipulated
Step 3: Import the csv file into SQL Developer
Step 4: Save your app's server.R and ui.R script inside the 02 Shiny folder
Step 5: Launch the shinyApp with runApp and exit by clicking escape

#Data Summary:
Below is the dataset and first ten rows
```{r}
require("jsonlite")
require("RCurl")
require(ggplot2)
require(dplyr)

df <- data.frame(fromJSON(getURL(URLencode('skipper.cs.utexas.edu:5001/rest/native/?query="select * from edudata"'),httpheader=c(DB='jdbc:oracle:thin:@sayonara.microlab.cs.utexas.edu:1521:orcl', USER='C##cs329e_gmg954', PASS='orcl_gmg954', MODE='native_mode', MODEL='model', returnDimensions = 'False', returnFor = 'JSON'), verbose = TRUE)), ignoreNULL = FALSE)

head(df)
``` 
###Data Explanation and Overal Manipulation:

Education is one of the most powerful instruments for reducing poverty and inequality and lays a foundation for sustained economic growth. The World Bank compiles data on education inputs, participation, efficiency, and outcomes. This data on education was compiled by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics from official responses to surveys and from reports provided by education authorities in each country.

Below are all of the key indicators from our project:
```{r}
require("jsonlite")
require("RCurl")
require(ggplot2)
require(dplyr)

df <- data.frame(fromJSON(getURL(URLencode('skipper.cs.utexas.edu:5001/rest/native/?query="select distinct(indicator_name) from edudata order by indicator_name desc"'),httpheader=c(DB='jdbc:oracle:thin:@sayonara.microlab.cs.utexas.edu:1521:orcl', USER='C##cs329e_gmg954', PASS='orcl_gmg954', MODE='native_mode', MODEL='model', returnDimensions = 'False', returnFor = 'JSON'), verbose = TRUE)), ignoreNULL = FALSE)

head(df)
```

#Shiny Methodology
* Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications (apps) straight from R.
* Shiny ui.R scripts use the function fluidPage to create a display that automatically adjusts to the dimensions of your userâ€™s browser window. You lay out your app by placing elements in the fluidPage function.The user-interface (ui) script controls the layout and appearance of your app. It is defined in a source script named ui.R. Additionally, the server.R script contains the instructions that your computer needs to build your app.
* Most of the script is wrapped in a call to renderPlot. This is an expression that generates a histogram. renderPlot indicates that the expression is "reactive" and should automatically re-execute whenver input changes. It also specifies that the output type is a plot.

#Visualizations:

This box plot shows the student-teacher ratios for the years 2000 and 2012 for both primary and secondary schools.  We can see that in both years the student-teacher ratio for secondary schools is smaller than primary schools.  We also can see that there has been an imporvement in student teacher ratios from 2000 to 2012.  The interquartiles range has also decreased which means there is less spread in the data.
